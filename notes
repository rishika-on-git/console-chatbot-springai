long is primitive and holds the actual value. it cannot be null
Long is an object that is a wrapper of long primitive. It has extra features (methods)
Java objects , Lists , Strings all allow Long only.

Use long when you know value will always exist and you do calculations.

Use Long when: value can be missing (null)
-you are using List<Long>, Map<Long, ...> etc
-frameworks like Spring/JPA sometimes prefer wrapper types for optional fields


-project example (mapped clearly)

ChatMessage msg = new AiMessage(...);

* `ChatMessage` → parent type (reference)
* `AiMessage` → child type (actual object)

This is allowed in sendMessage because:
> **AiMessage IS-A ChatMessage**

Why Java allows this
Because it lets you write **flexible code**.
Your method:

ChatMessage sendMessage(...)

Can later return:

* `AiMessage`
* `UserMessage`
* `SystemMessage`

Without changing the method signature.

> **Runtime polymorphism lets a parent reference hold a child object,
> and the actual object decides behavior at runtime.
> `instanceof` is how we safely check what that object really is.**
